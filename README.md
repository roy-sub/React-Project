## React Project


In this project I have created a simple To Do Web application which supports the following operations:

- The user can add tasks (Example: Complete MERN Assignnment )
- The user can delete his/her tasks
- The user should be able to mark certain tasks as done and they will be automatically added to the “Done” category. The tasks of “Done” category should be striked off and should be at the bottom of any list.
